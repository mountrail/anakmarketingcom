<p>
    I can show you the world<br />Shining, shimmering, splendid<br />Tell me,
    princess, now when did<br />You last let your heart decide?</p>

<p>
    I can open your eyes<br />Take you wonder by wonder<br />Over, sideways and
    under<br />On a magic carpet ride
</p>

<p>A whole new world<br />A new fantastic point of view<br />No one to tell us no<br />Or where to go<br />Or say we're only dreaming</p>
